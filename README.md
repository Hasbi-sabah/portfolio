# 💼 Personal Portfolio Website

## 🔖 Project Title & Description
**Title:** Personal Portfolio Website  
**Description:**  
A modern, responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my work as a software engineer. The site will act as a professional hub where recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators can quickly understand who I am, what I build, and how to reach me.  

**Who it’s for:**  
- Recruiters and hiring managers looking for an overview of my skills and experience  
- Potential collaborators or clients interested in my past projects  
- A general audience that wants to learn more about my technical work and background  

**Why it matters:**  
Having a dedicated portfolio provides more depth than a LinkedIn profile and more context than a GitHub repo list. It highlights not just *what* I’ve built, but also *how* I think, solve problems, and approach engineering challenges. It also serves as a single, professional digital identity.

## 🤖 AI Integration Strategy

To accelerate development and keep quality high, I will integrate AI tools throughout the build process. The focus is not on replacing engineering effort, but on streamlining repetitive tasks, scaffolding code, and maintaining consistent documentation.

### 🔧 Code Generation
- Use AI-powered IDE extensions (e.g. GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or a CLI agent) to scaffold React components, Next.js page templates, and TailwindCSS layouts.  
- Prompt AI to generate boilerplate configurations (e.g. ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind config) and reduce time spent on setup.  
- Apply AI suggestions for repetitive UI patterns while keeping final design/logic decisions manual to avoid “AI spaghetti code.”

### 🧪 Testing
- Use AI prompts to generate initial test cases for **unit tests** (React components, utility functions) and **integration tests** (page flows, routing).  
- Request AI to expand coverage by generating edge-case scenarios I might overlook.  
- Employ context-aware prompting: feeding in existing component code so AI writes tests tailored to real props, states, and hooks.  

### 📚 Documentation
- Generate draft **docstrings** and inline comments with AI to explain logic clearly and consistently.  
- Use AI to keep **README** and other project documentation updated by feeding it file diffs or commit messages to summarize new features.  
- Ensure AI-crafted text is reviewed and edited manually to maintain voice, clarity, and accuracy.  

### 🧩 Context-Aware Techniques
- Provide AI with **API specs** (REST/GraphQL schemas) to generate client functions or validate API calls.  
- Feed **file trees** into prompts when generating higher-level architectural suggestions (e.g. restructuring components, creating shared utilities).  
- Share **git diffs** with AI to produce changelog entries, commit message drafts, or auto-updated documentation tied to specific code changes.  

This strategy ensures AI remains an accelerant, not a crutch, while keeping code quality, test coverage, and documentation at professional standards.
