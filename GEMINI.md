# ðŸ›  GEMINI AI INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Always read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` first.** Use it as the authoritative reference for stack, structure, conventions, and workflow.  

2. **Generate code, tests, and docs** strictly according to `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Follow React/Next.js, TailwindCSS, ESLint/Prettier, and project conventions.  

3. **After code changes**, compare diffs with context. Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` if layout, features, or conventions change. Provide suggested changes or diffs.  

4. **Context checks before action:**  
   - Does this affect structure, dependencies, or conventions?  
   - Are tests or documentation affected?  
   - Are instructions consistent with stack and standards?  

5. **Maintain clarity and accuracy.** No filler or irrelevant content.  

6. **Always prepare diffs** for context updates for human review.
